### Current

*SP Phase 1*

* Add column inhibition radius (aka? input spread. calc with.)
* Synapse Data fill
  * small random range around ThresholdSynapsePermanence
  * bias towards 90-deg vertical overhead connections between column/input
  * input spread is random, not linear.  make sure no orphans after change.

### Future

* pg int's not unsigned.  
  * for input indexes[], you've now got a trinary if u want!
* 3 state not as enum/type, but as true/false/null ?
